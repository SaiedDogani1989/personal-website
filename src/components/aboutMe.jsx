                            <p>I am an ambitious Frontend Web Developer and I am 31 years old. My carrier started
                            from December 2019 , I have bachelor degree in telecommunication and associate's degree in
                            ICT, at first I started to learn HTML and CSS and great my first web page and I call that
                            page Solo Learn because I started to learn with Solo Learn application.<br />
                            After that I started to learn javaScript and add some javaScript codes to my Solo Learn page.
                            After these first steps I attend to some online courses such as native courses and
                            international courses and learnt these 3 fundamental courses in deep specially
                            javaScript. Then I started to learn React.js and pass online react courses in Code With Mosh Website,
                            I kept learning and started an online BootCamp course in Udemy. This BootCamp really helps me
                            to understand deeply about Frontend and Backend. However I am focusing on Frontend and the fist impression
                            on client because in my point of view it is so important and also user experience and their emotions
                            about using a website and find out what their problems are and solve them is so important too.</p>
